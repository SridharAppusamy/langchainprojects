If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",

When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job.

I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4.

I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and assured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

      "President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is addressing the nation and those living abroad, marking the end of his 5-year term as President of India. He expresses gratitude to all those he has worked with during his tenure, representing various fields and communities. He shares 10 important messages that he has learned during his interactions with people across the country, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development, particularly for the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages\n",
      "3. Leveraging rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Promoting agricultural growth through \"Seed to Food\"\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems and succeeding\n",
      "6. Partnering to overcome challenges\n",

      "9. Defending the nation\n",
      "10. Mobilizing the youth for a Developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. He praises her question and assures her that he is committed to working towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, implying that they would work towards making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of Indian youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. The speaker, President of India, mentions his visit to Nagaland where he saw an empowered village council functioning with financial powers, taking decisions, and producing fruits and vegetables. He emphasizes the need to provide physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products from villages to markets. The speaker also highlights an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which provides urban amenities in rural areas, including physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity. This initiative has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is highlighting the success of the Periyar PURA (Poverty and Unemployment Reduction through Alternative Activities) project in Periyar villages. The project has achieved:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs through 1000 self-help groups\n",
      "* Development of 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land\n",
      "* Cultivation of Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, as well as power generation using bio-mass and food processing\n",
      "* Establishment of marketing centers\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has also collaborated with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products. This has enhanced the innovative ability of the people and enabled them to produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker believes that similar PURA projects are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with an estimated 7000 projects required to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is sharing two enriching experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Meeting over 6000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They also express confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "2. Meeting Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born without hands and legs, who despite his physical limitations, was radiant and confident. He thanked God, his parents, and others for giving him confidence, training, and help. When asked what he wanted, he replied that he would like to sing in front of the speaker. This experience taught the speaker that even in the face of adversity, people can find joy and purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about two inspiring stories. The first story is about a physically challenged individual who, despite his limitations, has a latent talent for music. With the encouragement of his parents, teachers, and others, he has developed his skills and now wants to use his music to inspire others. The speech highlights the importance of positivity, perseverance, and support in helping people overcome their challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the resilience of the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage to their school and other infrastructure, the villagers have come together to overcome their challenges and rebuild their community. The speech emphasizes the importance of partnership and collaboration in overcoming the impact of disasters, citing the role of the Army, Air Force, and state government in providing relief and support to the affected area.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a reflection on the author's experiences with courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The author describes visiting a village affected by an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers bravely participating in relief efforts and interacting with authorities to settle relief grants. The author also shares a personal anecdote about visiting the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they met with tribal council leaders and children who had lost loved ones. Despite their losses, the islanders showed remarkable courage and resilience, and the author was inspired to compose a poem, \"Sea Waves\", to capture their spirit. Finally, the author mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament, where they emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a project that would connect 53 African countries through satellite, fiber optics, and wireless networks at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* 53 tele-medicine centers\n",
      "* 53 tele-education centers in Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, and Indira Gandhi National Open University has started an MBA course for 34 Ethiopian students. Additionally, specialists from CARE Hospital in India will provide tele-medicine services to African countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be by an Indian official or leader, likely the Prime Minister, based on the references to Indian experiences and institutions. The speech highlights two key areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. India's contributions to African development: The speaker mentions that India has been providing tele-consultation services to doctors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, since 2006, and has enabled instant communication between the 53 African countries through the Pan African network. This is seen as a way to bring societal transformation to the African continent.\n",
      "2. National pride and defense: The speaker expresses pride in the bravery and dedication of India's defense forces, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, who are always vigilant and ready to counter any threat to the nation. The speaker also acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces and police personnel in maintaining the safety and security of Indian citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speech mentions a youth movement called \"Lead India 2020\" that aims to transform Indian youth into enlightened citizens, with a focus on development and progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They mention the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in Medak district, to instill values such as self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of responsibility towards the nation. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student who, inspired by the program, helped her father quit smoking. The speaker believes that with the country's 540 million youth under the age of 25, who are the most powerful resource on earth, it is essential to empower them through value-based education and leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich and diverse culture and civilization for future generations. The speaker notes that while India has made significant progress in the last 60 years, there is still much work to be done to empower its people, particularly its 540 million youth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020 and encourages citizens to work towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines five key objectives for achieving this goal, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reducing the urban-rural divide\n",
      "2. Ensuring equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Integrating agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Providing education with a value system to all meritorious candidates, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. Becoming the best destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by quoting a famous poem, \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" and encourages the youth to strive for greatness, assuring that their dreams will come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines a vision for a ideal nation, which includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Access to quality healthcare for all\n",
      "* Responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance\n",
      "* Eradication of poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* A society where no one feels alienated\n",
      "* A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy nation with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, the speaker envisions a country that prioritizes the well-being and equality of its citizens, with a focus on economic, social, and environmental sustainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The President of India, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, expresses gratitude to the citizens for their support and cooperation over the past five years. He praises India as a great nation and leader, and shares his personal mission to bring people together and instill confidence in the nation's abilities. He concludes by stating that he will continue to work towards making India a developed nation by 2020, and ends with a prayer for God's blessings and a nationalistic slogan, \"Jai Hind\".\n",
